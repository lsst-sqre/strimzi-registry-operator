# strimzi-registry-operator

A Kubernetes Operator for running the [Confluent Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/index.html) in a [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io)-based [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) cluster that's optionally secured with TLS.

Overview:

- Once you deploy a `StrimziSchemaRegistry` resource, the operator creates a Kubernetes deployment of the Confluent Schema Registry, along with an associated Kubernetes service and secret.
- Works with Strimzi's TLS authentication and authorization by converting the TLS certificate associated with a KafkaUser into a JKS-formatted keystore and truststore that's used by Confluence Schema Registry.
- When Strimzi updates either the Kafka cluster's CA certificate or the KafkaUser's client certificates, the operator automatically recreates the JKS truststore/keystore secrets and triggers a rolling restart of the Schema Registry pods.

## Deploy the operator

There are two steps for running strimzi-registry-operator.
First, you'll need to deploy the operator itself â€” this is described in this section.
Once the operator is deployed, you can deploy `StrimziSchemaRegistry` resources that actually create and maintain a Confluent Schema Registry application (this is discussed in later sections).

Two operator deployment options are available: [Helm](https://helm.sh) and [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io).

### With Helm

A Helm chart is available for strimzi-registry-operator on GitHub at [lsst-sqre/charts](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/charts/tree/master/charts/strimzi-registry-operator):

```sh
helm repo add lsstsqre https://lsst-sqre.github.io/charts/
helm repo update
helm install lsstsqre/strimzi-registry-operator --name ssr --set clusterNamespace="...",clusterName="..."
```

[See the Helm chart's README](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/charts/tree/master/charts/strimzi-registry-operator) for important values to set, including the names of the Strimzi Kafka cluster and namespace for `KafkaUser` resources to watch.

### With Kustomize

The manifests for the operator itself are located in the `/manifests` directory of this repository.
You can use Kustomize to build a single YAML file for deployment:

```sh
kustomize build manifests > manifest.yaml
kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml
```

To configure the name of the Strimzi cluster and the namespace where `KafkaUser` resources are available, you'll need to create your own Kustomize overlay.

A basic ``kustomization.yaml`` file is:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
  - github.com/lsst-sqre/strimzi-registry-operator.git//manifests?ref=0.5.0

patches:
  - strimzi-registry-operator-deployment.yaml
```

Use the `strimzi-registry-operator-deployment.yaml` patch to set environment variables:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: strimzi-registry-operator
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: operator
          env:
            - name: SSR_CLUSTER_NAME
              value: events
            - name: SSR_NAMESPACE
              value: events
```

- `SSR_CLUSTER_NAME` is the name of the Strimzi Kafka cluster.
- `SSR_NAMESPACE` is the namespace where the Strimzi Kafka cluster is deployed and where `KafkaUser` resources are found.

## Deploy a Schema Registry

### Step 1. Deploy a KafkaTopic

Deploy a `KafkaTopic` that the Schema Registry will use as its primary storage.

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  name: registry-schemas
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: events
spec:
  partitions: 1
  replicas: 3
  config:
    # http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs
    cleanup.policy: compact
```

> **Note**
> The name `registry-schemas` is currently required.
> The default name, `_schemas` isn't used because it isn't convenient to create with `KafkaTopic` resources.

### Step 2. Deploy a KafkaUser

Deploy a `KafkaUser` for the Schema Registry that gives the Schema Registry sufficient permissions:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: KafkaUser
metadata:
  name: confluent-schema-registry
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: events
spec:
  authentication:
    type: tls
  authorization:
    # Official docs on authorizations required for the Schema Registry:
    # https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/security/index.html#authorizing-access-to-the-schemas-topic
    type: simple
    acls:
      # Allow all operations on the registry-schemas topic
      # Read, Write, and DescribeConfigs are known to be required
      - resource:
          type: topic
          name: registry-schemas
          patternType: literal
        operations:
          - All
        type: allow
      # Allow all operations on the schema-registry* group
      - resource:
          type: group
          name: schema-registry
          patternType: prefix
        operations:
          - All
        type: allow
      # Allow Describe on the __consumer_offsets topic
      - resource:
          type: topic
          name: __consumer_offsets
          patternType: literal
        operations:
          - Describe
        type: allow
```

### Step 3. Deploy the StrimziSchemaRegistry

Now that there is a topic and a user, you can deploy the Schema Registry itself.
The strimzi-schema-registry operator deploys the Schema Registry given a `StrimziSchemaRegistry` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: roundtable.lsst.codes/v1beta1
kind: StrimziSchemaRegistry
metadata:
  name: confluent-schema-registry
spec:
  strimziVersion: v1beta2
  listener: tls
```

[The next section](#strimzischemaregistry-configuration-properties) describes the configuration properties for the `StrimziSchemaRegistry`.

## StrimziSchemaRegistry configuration properties

These configurations can be set as fields of the `StrimziSchemaRegistry`'s `spec` field:

```yaml
apiVersion: roundtable.lsst.codes/v1beta1
kind: StrimziSchemaRegistry
metadata:
  name: confluent-schema-registry
spec:
  strimziVersion: v1beta2
  listener: tls
  securityProtocol: tls
  compatibilityLevel: forward
  registryImage: confluentinc/cp-schema-registry
  registryImageTag: "7.2.1"
  cpuLimit: ""
  cpuRequest: ""
  memoryLimit: ""
  memoryRequest: ""
```

### Strimzi-related configurations

- `strimziVersion` is the version of the `kafka.strimzi.io` Custom Resource API to use.
  The correct value depends on the deployed version of Strimzi.
  The current Strimzi API  version is `v1beta2`.

### Schema Registry-related configurations

- `listener` is the **name** of the Kafka listener that the Schema Registry should use.
  The default value is `tls`, but you should set this value based on your `Kafka` resource.
  The ["In-detail: listener configuration"](#in-detail-listener-configuration) section, below, explains this in more detail.
  See also: Schema Registry [listeners](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/installation/config.html#listeners) docs.

- `securityProtocol` is the security protocol for the Schema Registry to communicate with Kafka. Default is SSL. Can be:

  - `SSL`
  - `PLAINTEXT`
  - `SASL_PLAINTEXT`
  - `SASL_SSL`

  See also: Schema Registry [kafkastore.security.protocol](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/installation/config.html#kafkastore-security-protocol) docs.

- `compatibilityLevel` is the default schema compatibility level. Default is "forward". Possible values:

  - `none`
  - `backward`
  - `backward_transitive`
  - `forward`
  - `forward_transitive`
  - `full`
  - `full_transitive`

  See also: Schema Registry [schema.compatibility.level](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/installation/config.html#schema-compatibility-level) docs.

### Kubernetes configurations for the Schema Registry

- `registryImage` is the name of the Confluent Schema Registry Docker image (without the tag).
  Default is `confluentinc/cp-schema-registry`.

- `registryImageTag` is the name of the Schema Registry Docker image's tag.
  Use this property to change the version of the Confluent Schema Registry that you're deploying through the `StrimziSchemaRegistry`.
  Default is `7.2.1`.

- `cpuLimit` is the cap on CPU usage for the Schema Registry container. Default is to leave unset. Example `1000m` limits to 1 CPU.

- `cpuRequest` is the requested CPU for the Schema Registry container. Default is to leave unset. Example: `100m` requests 0.1 CPU.

- `memoryLimit` is the cap on memory usage for the Schema Registry container. Default is to leave unset. Example `1000M` limits to 1000 megabytes.

- `memoryRequest` is the requested memory for the Schema Registry container. Default is to leave unset. Example: `768M` requests 768 megabytes.

### In detail: listener configuration

The `spec.listener` field in the `StrimziSchemaRegistry` resource specifies the Kafka broker listener that the Schema Registry uses.
These listeners are configured in the `Kafka` resource you created with Strimzi.

Consider a `Kafka` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    #...
    listeners:
      - name: plain
        port: 9092
        type: internal
        tls: false
      - name: tls
        port: 9093
        type: internal
        tls: true
        authentication:
          type: tls
      - name: external1
        port: 9094
        type: route
        tls: true
      - name: external2
        port: 9095
        type: ingress
        tls: true
        authentication:
          type: tls
        configuration:
          bootstrap:
            host: bootstrap.myingress.com
          brokers:
          - broker: 0
            host: broker-0.myingress.com
          - broker: 1
            host: broker-1.myingress.com
          - broker: 2
            host: broker-2.myingress.com
    #...
```

To use the encrypted internal listener, the `spec.listener` field in your `StrimziSchemaRegistry` resource should be `tls`:

```yaml
apiVersion: roundtable.lsst.codes/v1beta1
kind: StrimziSchemaRegistry
metadata:
  name: confluent-schema-registry
spec:
  listener: tls
```

To use the unencrypted internal listener instead, the `spec.listener` field in your `StrimziSchemaRegistry` resource should be `plain` instead:

```yaml
apiVersion: roundtable.lsst.codes/v1beta1
kind: StrimziSchemaRegistry
metadata:
  name: confluent-schema-registry
spec:
  listener: plain
```

### Strimzi `v1beta1` listener configuration

In older versions of Strimzi with the `v1beta1` API, listeners were not named.
Instead, three types of listeners were available:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
kind: Kafka
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    listeners:
      plain: {}
      tls:
        authentication:
          type: "tls"
      external: {}
```

In this case, set the `spec.listener` field in your `StrimziSchemaRegistry` to either `plain`, `tls`, or `external`.
